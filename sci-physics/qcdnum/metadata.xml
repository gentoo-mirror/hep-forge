The qcdnum program numerically solves the evolution equations for parton den-
sities and fragmentation functions in perturbative QCD. Un-polarised parton den-
sities can be evolved up to next-to-next-to-leading order in powers of the strong
coupling constant, while polarised densities or fragmentation functions can be
evolved up to next-to-leading order. In addition to these evolution routines, a
large set of tools is provided to solve n-fold coupled QCD evolution equations and
to compute convolution integrals in the zero-mass or generalised mass schemes.
Based on this toolbox and included in the software distribution are two add-on
packages to calculate zero-mass structure functions in un-polarised deep inelas-
tic scattering, and heavy flavour contributions to these structure functions in the
fixed flavour number scheme.
