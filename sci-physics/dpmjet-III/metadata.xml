    DPMJET-III is a Monte Carlo event generator for hadron, photon and nuclear collisions with a several decade-long history. DPMJET is an integral part of FLUKA, a fully integrated particle physics MonteCarlo simulation package, acting as event generator for nucleus-nucleus collisions above 5 GeV/nucleon and for hadronic collisions at high energies. DPMJET-III embeds the PHOJET event generator, which is used for simulations of hadron-hadron, photon-hadron and photon-photon collisions. This and future versions of PHOJET will be distributed as part of this DPMJET package. Both codes are interfaced to Pythia 6 for hadronization.
