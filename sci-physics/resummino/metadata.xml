Resummino computes predictions for selected Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) processes at hadron colliders. In the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) predictions at approximate NNLO+NNLL are available for slepton-pair and electroweakino-pair production (these processes are also available with a collinear improved version of threshold resummation for NLO+NLL); predictions at LO are available for gaugino-squark production.

In general BSM models with extended gauge sectors, predictions for Z' and W' production are available at approximate NNLO+NNLL accuracy. The code is able to compute total cross sections as well as invariant-mass and transverse-momentum distributions (only for Drell-Yan-like processes).

Note that this version includes LoopTools-2.13 (instead of QCD-loops) for the evaluation of the loop integrals which has to be installed and linked to resummino.

This is open-source software under the terms of the European Union Public Licence, version 1.1 or later, and is actively developed by Juri Fiaschi in the Particle Physics Group at the University of Liverpool and Alexander Neuwirth in the Research Group of Prof. Dr. Michael Klasen at the Institut für Theoretische Physik, Universität Münster, Germany.
