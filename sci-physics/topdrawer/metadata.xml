	TOPDRAWER is a keyword-driven interface to the SLAC
	Unified Graphics system, designed  specifically  to
	generate  physics  graphs  with  minimal specifica-
	tions.  Reasonable defaults are  assumed  for  axis
	scales,  tic  locations,  label locations and size,
	etc.
	
	Topdrawer  originated  at  the  Stanford Linear Ac-
	celerator Center.  The  manual  for  this  modified
	version            is           online           in
	TOPDRAWERROOT:[DOC]TOPDRAWER.DOC,  and  via   HELP,
	both at the VMS level and within the Topdrawer pro-
	gram.  The original SLAC document  number  is  CTGM
	178.
	
	Many  devices are supported, including Xwindows and
	Tektronix displays,  and  Postscript,  QMS1200  and
	EXCL printers.
