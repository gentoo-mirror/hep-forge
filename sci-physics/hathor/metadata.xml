    Hathor calculates the total cross section for top-quark pair production in hadronic collisions.
    The program takes into account recent theoretical developments such as approximate
    next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative QCD corrections and it allows for studies of
    the theoretical uncertainty by separate variations of the factorization and renormalization
    scales. In addition it offers the possibility to obtain the cross section as a function of the
    running top-quark mass. A GUI to simplify the usage is included as well.
