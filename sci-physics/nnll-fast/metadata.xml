    NNLL-fast is a computer program which computes the squark and gluino hadroproduction cross sections including approximate next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLOApprox) supersymmetric QCD corrections and the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic (NNLL) accuracy, including the resummation of Coulomb gluons with a NLO Coulomb potential and bound-state contributions below the production threshold. NNLL-fast also provides an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty due to scale variation, the parton distribution functions, and the value of the strong coupling αs. The program reads in grid files with NLO and NNLOApprox+NNLL results, the scale uncertainty and the PDF and αs error and uses a fast interpolation routine to provide predictions for any value of squark and gluino masses in the mass ranges specified below. The results are provided for the latest LHC collision energy of 13.6 TeV for Run 3, and will be updated for future runs of the LHC. The predictions are created with the recent PDF4LHC21_40_pdfas PDF sets.
