	This program provides a SUSY spectrum in the NMSSM, or the MSSM including flavour violation and with or without R-parity consistent with input Standard Model fermion mass/mixings and electroweak/strong coupling data. The R-parity violating mode can calculate neutrino masses and mixings to 1 loop. SOFTSUSY can be used in conjunction with other programs for many different particle physics calculations. SOFTSUSY now has a mode with 3 loop RGEs and some 2-loop threshold correction and 2-loop SUSY QCD corrections to gluino and squark pole masses. SOFTSUSY now computes decay branching ratios for the MSSM and NMSSM. It also ships with (and links to) Himalaya-1.0 for three-loop corrections to mh0.
