        The Scikit-HEP project is a community-driven and community-oriented project with the aim of providing Particle Physics at large with an ecosystem for data analysis in Python embracing all major topics involved in a physicist's work. The project started in Autumn 2016 and its packages are actively developed and maintained.

        It is not just about providing core and common tools for the community. It is also about improving the interoperability between HEP tools and the Big Data scientific ecosystem in Python, and about improving on discoverability of utility packages and projects.
